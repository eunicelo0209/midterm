      <h2>Backstory</h2>
      <p>The story revolves around Yuji Itadori, a high school student with exceptional physical abilities.

      <h2>Jujutsu Sorcerers</h2>
      <p>Jujutsu Sorcerers are people who control the flow of Cursed Energy in their bodies, allowing them to use it as they please and also to reduce its release. High-ranking Sorcerers and Curses can refine this energy and use it to perform Cursed Techniques, which tend to be unique to the user or their family. An advanced form of Cursed Technique is Domain Expansion, which the users build a pocket dimension of variable size. Inside the Domain, all of their attacks are guaranteed to hit and will grow in strength.</p>

      <h2>Clans</h2>
      <p>The three great sorcerer clans of the jujutsu world are the Zenin Clan, the Gojo Clan, and the Kamo Clan. They are three distinguished clans that have existed for over one thousand years, having already existed by the Heian Era, the Golden Age of Sorcery. Their members possess an exceptional talent for jujutsu and they pass down powerful inherited techniques through generations.</p>
